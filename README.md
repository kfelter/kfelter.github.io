## Employment History
 
### Spotify
Backend Software Engineer II (Golang) 01/2021 - Present

Megaphone was purchased by Spotify, my contributions to the adserver and content delivery code around Streaming
Ad Insertion was a large contributor to the deal. I still lead the backend development team that focuses on scaling up
to 1 billion podcast downloads a month and beyond.

* migrated our infrastructure from on prem machines running rancher to gke in google cloud
* upgraded a large batch job that to an event driven system that improved accuracy, observability, reliability, speed and scaling potential of the system
* created new revenue streams by adding the ability to communicate via the VAST spec to our adserver
* created a new reporting pipeline to track ad impression events for billing purposes 
* created Streaming Ad Insertion Tracking capabilities for podcasting
* led code walkthrough's to help other developers understand the business logic of applications

### Megaphone
Software Engineer (Golang) 09/2019 - 01/2021

Megaphone is a leader in technology supporting podcasts. I am the lead developer on the backend services that
support audio streaming and dynamic advertisement insertion.

* migrated audio data services from heroku with a managed cdn to kubernetes on bare metal
* improved audio delivery architecture using golang/nginx/docker/kubernetes
* added features to the advertisement delivery service written in golang
* setup CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment of code updates
* debugged large systems
* mentored junior golang developers through PRs and 1 on 1 meetings

### Decipher Technology Studios
Software Engineer (Golang) 11/2018 - 09/2019

Decipher used the envoy proxy along with golang plugins to create a tool to manage a service mesh architecture. They also created a product to encrypt blobs of data before uploading encrypted blobs to s3, along with a complex authorization solution. I worked on the authorization solution for the data encryption product.

* api integration using golang to write and consume restful apis
* wrote a service to generate and sign jwt tokens with complex authorization structures using lisp
* created and maintained CI/CD pipeline written in circleci YAML
* dockerized golang applications for deployments using kubernetes

### Blackstone Technology Group
Software Engineer (Golang) 07/2017 - 11/2018

Blackstone was a government contracting agency that helped US DHS with all cloud applications and technology. 

* integrated AWS EC2 api, keycloak, Ansible, and Terraform to create a product that helped migrate DHS applications to the AWS cloud
* wrote go code to integrate the services into a single api
* wrote Angular/Typescript to consume the api and be a full stack application
* integrated hashicorp products into the EC2 instances like consul and vault

## Education History

Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University 
Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering

I started out as an Electrical engineer but found myself writing code to solve most of my homework and exams. This
lead me to change majors into computer engineering, which focuses on creating practical solutions with software to
solve real world problems.
