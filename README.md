## About

With my deep expertise in Golang development, I have consistently delivered highly efficient, reliable solutions to even the most daunting engineering challenges. I have a proven track record of creating and maintaining massive data pipelines, robust public APIs, and critical background processing jobs. And when it comes to infrastructure management, I have employed a range of powerful tools - Prometheus, Grafana, Pager Duty, New Relic - to ensure the uninterrupted operation of mission-critical services.

## Education History

Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University 
Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering

I started out as an Electrical engineer but found myself writing code to solve most of my homework and exams. This
lead me to change majors into computer engineering, which focuses on creating practical solutions with software to
solve real world problems.
